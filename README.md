# TVShowRatingProject
In this project, I worked to do some basic analysis and visualization of the ratings for a select tv show, Arrested Development.

To begin, I navigated to the IDMB website to download a few of their free-to-use datasets. I imported the data, then proceeding to clean and structure it for my later analysis and visualization. This project did not lend itself to extensive data analysis, but rather, was a better opportunity to showcase my familiarity with Python and my keen interest in data visualization. Basic descriptive statistics were computed and used for the plotting of the data with regards to the mean and the standard deviation. My concluding remarks about the project and its takeaways appear at the end of the project file. 

This project leaves plenty of opportunity to apply to other shows as well.
